# Ancestor Frequency Difference (AFD) : distance for tumor trees

AFD is a new method for measuring dissimilarity between mutation or clonal trees.
This repo contain the source code to compute AFD in 'src/' and the data and scripts to run the evaluations of AFD in `scripts/`.

## Set up

The implementation of AFD was built and tested with `Python 3.13`.
To install AFD in your environnement run the following command:
```bash
pip install -e src/
```

## Usage
